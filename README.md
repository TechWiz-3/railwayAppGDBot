# railwayAppGDBot

A bot I created for my server Gravity Destroyers SW and hosted on Railway App, the bots code has currently not been cleaned up.
The bot has a few functional features, other than these it has some `on_message` functions such as one that triggers a random message from a list every 300 or so messages.
`.compliment`
`.helperping`
`.random_yt`

Proper documentation coming soon 🙏 ... hopefully
