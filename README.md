A bot I created for my server Gravity Destroyers SW and hosted on Railway App, the bots code has currently not been cleaned up.

The bot has a few slash and regular commands listed here:  
`/hello`  
`.compliment <@user>`  
`.random_yt`  
`/random_yt_vid`  
`.motivation_quote`  
`/motivatonal_quote`  
`.bump_rewards`  
`/bumper rewards` 
`/bumper level`
`/bump_leaderboard`
`/random_words`  

Proper documentation coming soon... hopefully
